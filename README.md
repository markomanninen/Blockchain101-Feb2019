# Welcome!
## Building Blockchain networks 101

In this workshop you will get familiar with Blockchain concepts and start by creating your own smart contract. 
During lab 2 you will build your first Blockchain application and connect it to IBM Blockchain Platform running in IBM Kubernetes Service. 

Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
