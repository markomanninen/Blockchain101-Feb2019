# Deploy your first contract

This lab is a technical introduction to blockchain, specifically smart contract development
using the latest developer enhancements in the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric v1.4
and shows you how IBM’s Blockchain Platform’s developer experience can accelerate your
pace of development.

## Lab Scenario
This lab is structured into 3 main parts. Each part will take you deeper into smart
contract development.

The first part of this lab will take you through using the smart contract development
environment in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Although smart contracts can be
developed in any editor, IBM Blockchain Platform provides a plugin for VSCode that
greatly simplifies the steps required. In addition, it also provides a “sandbox”
development environment for easy development and test purposes using a real
Hyperledger Fabric runtime.

The second part of this lab will take you through using a sample smart contract that
comes with Hyperledger Fabric through the VSCode lens, where you will learn how to
import contracts and interact with the development environment in more detail.

In part three of this lab you will use VSCode to connect to another Hyperledger Fabric
sample network, this time running outside of VSCode and learn how to interact with an
external network in order to deploy, upgrade and extend smart contracts belonging to
an existing network.
